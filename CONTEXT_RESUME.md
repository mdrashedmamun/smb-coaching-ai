# Consulting OS Recovery & Resume Manual

**Status:** Financial Physics Layer (Phase 0–2)
**Objective:** Revenue engineering & fundability core
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-16 (Post-Pivot)

## 1. System Paradigm
**System Mode:** Layer 1 — Financial Physics
**Nature:** Deterministic, auditable, underwriting-grade.
**Strategic Trajectory:** Consulting → Fundability → Islamic finance → Investment readiness

## 2. Current Phase Structure
**Current Focus:**
- **Phase 0 — Engagement Fit & Data Integrity** (Velvet Rope, Data Typing)
- **Phase 1 — Revenue Physics** (Deterministic Math, Goal/Gap Analysis)
- **Phase 2 — Unit Economics & Payback** (Margin, CAC, Payback Periods)

**Locked Layers (Future):**
- Layer 2 — Strategic Intelligence
- Layer 3 — Execution Intelligence

## 3. Non-Negotiables (Constitution)
1.  **Offer Portfolio → Primary Offer Selection:** All math must be offer-scoped.
2.  **Deterministic Revenue Math:** No AI guessing in financial columns. 1+1=2.
3.  **Explicit Scenario Mode:** "What if" scenarios must be clearly labeled as simulation.
4.  **No Silent Assumptions:** User must explicitly accept or input assumptions.
5.  **No Blended Metrics:** Isolating unit economics per offer is mandatory.
6.  **Underwriting-Grade Integrity:** Data must be clean enough for due diligence.

## 4. Where is the Project?
**Root Directory:**
`/Users/md.rashedmamun/Claude Code Projects/Antigravity Venture Studio/smb-coaching-ai`

**Pivot Context:**
We have moved beyond the "Coaching App" prototype. Features like "analytics" or "export" are secondary to the **Financial Physics Core**. We are building an economic engine, not just a UX.

## 5. Latest Work (2026-01-16 15:59:36 +06)
- Branch: `feature/high-ticket-os` committed and pushed; working tree clean.
- PR #1 `ci-lint-relax` pushed and should be merged first.
- PR #2 `feature/high-ticket-os` pushed; do not merge until checks A/B pass.
- Verification: run Simulation Mode lock + Primary Offer math checks locally before merging PR #2.
