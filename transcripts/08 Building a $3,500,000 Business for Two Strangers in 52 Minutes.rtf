\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 that way people cuz no one wants to make the decisions fundamentally. What's good, right? What's good? Exactly. So that way if you have each of the highest\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 ideally that we we want to make sure that it's really clear and it's prominent on on the on on the menu per box that they're\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 21:26\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 kind of working through. So any kind of business that has a menu and the term having a menu comes from restaurants\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 21:32\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 because many people have eaten at restaurants but you go to a mechanic shop there's a menu right and so in general I like having a couple things to\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 21:39\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 be true about my menus. One is that I prefer to start at the highest prices. And the reason for that is because it anchors and they've done research\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 21:45\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 studies on this in terms of how they lay out like wine menus. If you put the most expensive on the top, it anchors the remaining prices underneath of it. And\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 21:52\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 so number one, I like having higher prices higher. Number two, I like higher gross profit margins because two things\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 21:57\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 could be $16, but one of them might cost the restaurant $6, one of them might cost them $1. And remember that 99 cents\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 that we added added 30% to the profit of the business if executed no sales velocity drops. So, us having just get\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 22:10\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 more people to buy a thing that has $2 or three more dollars of profit can make an enormous difference to this business. The third piece that I that I want to\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 22:17\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 hit on is what's the stuff that that brings people back. Like, what's the stuff that's so good that they're like, "God, I have this again." And so,\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 22:22\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 balancing those three priorities is how I think through laying out a menu, whether it's a services business or it's\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 22:27\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 a restaurant. So, the next thing that I have for you, this is just menu. We're going to get into training stuff in a second with like how do we increase\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 22:32\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 alcohol sales and things like that. But what I want to do is increase the likelihood that people are already\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 thinking about it, right? And so there's two things that I want I want to think about. Number one is with each of the\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 from my next book that's coming out, but there are a number of ways that you can make a customer more valuable. There are eight of them. One of them is a\cb1 \

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 23:13\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 cross-ell, which is, do you want fries with that? For them, it's going to be, do you want an alcoholic beverage with that? And so, what I want to do is make\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 23:20\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 it as easy as possible for the customer to say yes, and I want to make it easy as possible for the staff to not forget.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 And so both of the tactics that I'm going to lay out for them are going to mirror those things. How to make it easy for the customer, remind them to do this\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 thing. And the thing is is they're getting 1% of their sales from alcohol, which is super high margin, right? So if\cb1 \

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 23:38\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 we can get that from like 1% to 6%. So just adding 5% to the business in terms of total revenue from this very high\cb1 \

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 that table jumps through the roof. And so we only need like one out of 10 tables to do that. We always thought\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 that's a certain color, whatever. But the reason it's so important is because then the whole staff knows, hey, these are first timers, right? And so\cb1 \

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 28:00\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 like that whatever the you know whatever the cheapest dessert is. Yeah. Something that would be but uh people remember\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 and they remember how things ended. Yeah. And so if we can just really make that ending really nice, I think that\cb1 \

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 28:38\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 would want to do is then give coupon of some sort. And the way that you can do this, if you want to do it classy, is\cb1 \

\fs31\fsmilli15600 \cf6 \cb7 \strokec6 28:51\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 back and then hand it to them. Okay? It's way better than a coupon, right? because then it feels like it's a\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 personalized gift, right? And so you say, "Hey, next time you come in, just bring this and I'll have another dessert\cb1 \
