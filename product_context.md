# SMB Coaching AI - Product Context

## Vision
A virtual business coaching app for SMBs (Small & Medium Businesses), specifically targeting non-Silicon Valley founders. The goal is to move beyond "checklists" and build "business infrastructure" that runs without the founder.

## The Problem (The 3 Silent Killers)
1.  **Offers no one understands**: Confused messaging kills sales.
2.  **Unpredictable Lead Flow**: Panic-driven marketing leads to burnout.
3.  **Inconsistent Messaging**: Vague pitches leave money on the table.

## The Solution
An app that provides precision tools, smart workflows, and step-by-step diagnostics to show tailored business coaching.

## Key Modules/Deliverables
1.  **A 10x Offer That Converts**: A one-line offer generator with proof, emotion, and relevance.
2.  **Leak-Free Sales Funnel Blueprint**: A visual map to diagnose drop-off points.
3.  **Offer Diagnostic**: A tool to analyze price-value alignment.
4.  **Pre-Qualification System**: A filter to separate serious buyers from freebie-seekers.
5.  **Channel Strategy Grid**: A "Kill/Keep/Scale" grid to optimize ad spend.
6.  **Calendar-Based Lead Engine**: A weekly system for compounding lead flow.
7.  **Funding-Ready Pitch**: A narrative builder for funding results.

## Target Audience
"Real" business owners (Main Street, Service Business, Agency owners) who are buried in day-to-day operations and need systems to scale.
