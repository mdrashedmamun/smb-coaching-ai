# Skill: Bottleneck Conversion

**Goal:** Improve Call-to-Deal Conversion Rate (>30%)

## The Physics
If you are getting calls but not closing them, the issue is trust or clarity, not the leads.

## Diagnosis
- [ ] Do you have a script?
- [ ] Are you recording calls?
- [ ] Are you pre-framing the call?

## Prescription
1.  **Record**: Use Fathom or Fireflies.
2.  **Review**: Watch your last 3 lost calls.
3.  **Refine**: Identify the exact moment they disengaged.
