# Skill: Bottleneck Follow-Up

**Goal:** Improve Lead-to-Call Booking Rate (>15%)

## The Physics
Leads are interested but busy. Your job is to be persistently helpful, not annoying.

## Diagnosis
- [ ] How many times do you follow up? (Benchmark: 5-7 times)
- [ ] How fast do you respond? (Benchmark: <15 mins)
- [ ] What is your channel mix? (Email, SMS, LinkedIn)

## Prescription
1.  **Volume**: Increase follow-up attempts to 5 minimum.
2.  **Speed**: Respond immediately.
3.  **Value**: Send a resource, not just "bumping this".
