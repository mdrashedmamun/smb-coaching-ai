## How to Use This
This is a reproducible teardown playbook. Follow the steps in order, collect the minimum inputs, and produce the outputs exactly as written. If you use assumptions, log them and label the result as scenario.

## Business Snapshot (Verbatim Anchors)
- "Our revenue over the last 12 months has been 300,000" [0:22]
- "We lost a 100,000" [0:35]
- "We have services. We have education. ... software." [0:47]
- "So, we got got YouTube." [2:07]
- "the sales comes through DMs." [2:36]
- "The place that you don't intend people to go is where you make your money." [2:41]
- "we're going to sell them a package. And we're going to sell it to the outcome." [15:03]
- "we're just going to charge you for the outcome. Period." [15:27]
- "budget, authority, need, timing." [16:51]
- "I would love you to charge 5,000." [18:00]
- "you could probably sell for three grand." [20:46]
- "for every new follower you get, I want you to DM them" [22:15]

## Required Inputs (Minimum to Simulate)
- Revenue and profit by business unit (services, education, software)
- Top customer acquisition channel and conversion path
- Lead volume, opt-in rate, and sales conversion rates
- Current offer structure and pricing
- Sales process steps (DM -> call -> close)
- Capacity and delivery constraints (hours, team availability)

## Derived Metrics (From Transcript Numbers)
- Net loss: -100,000 on 300,000 revenue
- Services unit: 131,000 revenue with ~10,000 profit [1:13]
- Website visitors to opt-ins: 150 / 7,000 = ~2% [3:04]

## Step-by-Step Teardown Process

### Step 1: Identify the Profit Core and Cut Non-Essential Units
Goal: Stop the bleeding by focusing on what makes money.

Evidence:
- "We have services. We have education. ... software." [0:47]
- "We lost a 100,000" [0:35]

Decision rule:
- If a unit is consistently negative and not mission-critical, pause it and concentrate on the profitable unit.

Output:
- Profit core identified: services.
- Loss units flagged for pause or redesign.

### Step 2: Map the Real Acquisition Path
Goal: Align marketing with where revenue actually happens.

Evidence:
- "So, we got got YouTube." [2:07]
- "the sales comes through DMs." [2:36]
- "The place that you don't intend people to go is where you make your money." [2:41]

Decision rule:
- If sales occur in a different channel than the planned funnel, route traffic there intentionally.

Output:
- Primary path: YouTube -> Instagram -> DM -> Call -> Close.

### Step 3: Replace Low-Ticket Lifetime Offers with Outcome Packages
Goal: Increase revenue per client and remove price anchors.

Evidence:
- "we're going to sell them a package. And we're going to sell it to the outcome." [15:03]
- "we're just going to charge you for the outcome. Period." [15:27]

Decision rule:
- If low-ticket lifetime offers undercut service value, switch to outcome-based packages.

Output:
- New core offer: outcome-based package (not hourly, not lifetime course).

### Step 4: Raise Prices to Match Outcome Value
Goal: Realign pricing with delivered results.

Evidence:
- "I would love you to charge 5,000." [18:00]
- "you could probably sell for three grand." [20:46]

Decision rule:
- If conversion is strong at low price, test $3K-$5K outcomes.

Output:
- Price test band: $3,000-$5,000 per outcome package.

### Step 5: Qualify with BANT on the Call
Goal: Filter for buyers who can pay and are ready.

Evidence:
- "budget, authority, need, timing." [16:51]

Decision rule:
- If DM volume is high, use BANT to prioritize qualified prospects.

Output:
- BANT script inserted into call flow.

### Step 6: Convert Followers via DM Workflow
Goal: Turn audience growth into booked calls.

Evidence:
- "for every new follower you get, I want you to DM them" [22:15]

Decision rule:
- If audience grows but sales lag, implement proactive DM outreach.

Output:
- DM cadence: new follower -> DM -> qualification -> call link.

### Step 7: Simplify to One Core Offer + One Path
Goal: Reduce confusion across services, education, and software.

Evidence:
- "we're optimizing for this outcome, not three different outcomes" [39:10]

Decision rule:
- If multiple outcomes create confusion, pick one core outcome and one primary offer path.

Output:
- Single primary offer + optional education as a fallback.

### Step 8: Final Growth Physics Brief (Simulation Output)
Output should include:
- Profit core decision
- Primary acquisition path
- Outcome package definition and price band
- BANT qualification plan
- DM conversion workflow
- Simplified offer map

## Book Frameworks Applied (With Examples)

### 100M Offers - Outcome Positioning (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Offers, p. 43: "The pain is the pitch."

Example mapping:
- Outcome package solves the immediate legal pain (contracts, protection) and justifies higher pricing.

### 100M Leads - Core Offer First (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Leads, p. 48: "Advertising your core offer might be all you need to get leads to engage. Try this way first."

Example application:
- Route content traffic directly into DM and outcome package offer.

### 100M Money Models - Recurring Revenue Reality (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Money Models, p. 103: "Good gyms have lots of recurring revenue. I had none."

Example application:
- If recurring revenue is weak, focus on high-margin outcome packages first.

## Example Outputs (From This Case)
- Core offer: outcome-based legal package for artists
- Price band: $3K-$5K per outcome
- Primary path: YouTube -> IG -> DM -> Call -> Close
- Qualifier: BANT before calendar link

## Book Anchors (Direct Quotes)
- 100M Offers, p. 43: "The pain is the pitch."
- 100M Leads, p. 48: "Advertising your core offer might be all you need to get leads to engage. Try this way first."
- 100M Money Models, p. 103: "Good gyms have lots of recurring revenue. I had none."

## Simulation Checklist (Copy/Paste)
1) Break down revenue and profit by unit (services, education, software).
2) Identify the real sales channel and route traffic there.
3) Replace low-ticket lifetime offers with outcome packages.
4) Test $3K-$5K pricing band.
5) Insert BANT into call flow.
