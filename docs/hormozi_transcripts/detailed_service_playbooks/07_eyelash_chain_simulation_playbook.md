## How to Use This
This is a reproducible teardown playbook. Follow the steps in order, collect the minimum inputs, and produce the outputs exactly as written. If you use assumptions, log them and label the result as scenario.

## Business Snapshot (Verbatim Anchors)
- "empowering women with eyelash extension service with a revenue of 2.3 million 644,000 and 28% net margin." [0:22]
- "I have three problems. First is lead generations" [0:39]
- "Manager training is inconsistent" [0:45]
- "partner problems" [0:51]
- "If they decide they want to come back, how does that work?" [3:05]
- "book it then. just get it done rather than trying to rely on them coming back by chance" [3:23]
- "We pay our lash 50%." [4:17]
- "Number one, we're going to talk about pricing." [13:01]
- "membership that you're trying to put together" [13:04]
- "ads plus attribution" [13:22]
- "everything you want in life is on the other side of a few hard conversations" [16:32]

## Required Inputs (Minimum to Simulate)
- Revenue, profit, and margin by location
- Service pricing (initial set + refills)
- Artist compensation and COGS
- Lead sources and spend by channel
- New vs returning client ratios
- Retention duration and refill cadence
- Manager staffing ratios and training system
- Partnership equity and roles

## Derived Metrics (From Transcript Numbers)
- Net margin: 28% (stated)
- New vs returning: 30% new / 70% returning [6:00]
- Marketing spend: ~$12,000/year on $2.3M revenue (approx 0.5%) [5:27]

## Step-by-Step Teardown Process

### Step 1: Identify the Three Core Constraints
Goal: Separate growth blockers from ownership issues.

Evidence:
- "First is lead generations" [0:39]
- "Manager training is inconsistent" [0:45]
- "partner problems" [0:51]

Decision rule:
- If ownership conflict blocks execution, address partnership before scaling.

Output:
- Constraint list ranked: partnership, training, lead flow.

### Step 2: Lock In Refill Appointments (BAMFAM)
Goal: Increase repeat rate without relying on memory.

Evidence:
- "If they decide they want to come back, how does that work?" [3:05]
- "book it then. just get it done rather than trying to rely on them coming back by chance" [3:23]

Decision rule:
- If repeat visits are optional, schedule next appointment before client leaves.

Output:
- BAMFAM policy: book next refill at checkout.

### Step 3: Test Membership Only After BAMFAM
Goal: Stabilize recurring revenue without resistance.

Evidence:
- "membership that you're trying to put together" [13:04]

Decision rule:
- If recurring billing resistance is high, start with BAMFAM first.

Output:
- Membership deferred until BAMFAM adoption is high.

### Step 4: Adjust Pricing by Demand Windows
Goal: Use supply/demand to increase revenue on peak days.

Evidence:
- "Thursday, Friday, Saturday" busiest [6:17]
- "price typically can and should go up" [6:29]

Decision rule:
- If demand peaks are predictable, raise prices on peak days and discount off-peak.

Output:
- Peak pricing schedule + weekday discount strategy.

### Step 5: Increase Marketing Spend with Attribution
Goal: Scale lead flow with measurable ROI.

Evidence:
- "ads plus attribution" [13:22]
- "spending $12,000 on a $2.3 million business" [5:27]

Decision rule:
- If marketing spend is <1% of revenue and leads are constrained, increase spend with attribution tracking.

Output:
- Spend target: 1%-3% of revenue with attribution.

### Step 6: Fix Manager Training and Role Drift
Goal: Managers manage; artists produce.

Evidence:
- "Manager training is inconsistent" [0:45]
- "managers are spending most of their time doing lashes" [0:45]

Decision rule:
- If managers perform production work, restructure to protect training and QA.

Output:
- Manager role charter + training cadence.

### Step 7: Resolve Partner Misalignment
Goal: Remove structural friction from growth.

Evidence:
- "everything you want in life is on the other side of a few hard conversations" [16:32]

Decision rule:
- If partners are not aligned on roles and effort, renegotiate equity or responsibilities.

Output:
- Partner alignment plan with clear roles and accountability.

### Step 8: Final Growth Physics Brief (Simulation Output)
Output should include:
- Partnership resolution plan
- BAMFAM scheduling policy
- Pricing and demand strategy
- Marketing spend and attribution plan
- Manager training system
- Lead flow targets

## Book Frameworks Applied (With Examples)

### 100M Offers - Reduce Time Delay (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Offers, p. 62: "3. (Boo) Perceived Time Delay Between Start and Achievement (Goal: Decrease)"

Example mapping:
- BAMFAM reduces time between sessions, keeping clients in the habit loop.

### 100M Leads - Testing Discipline (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Leads, p. 171: "Get your first 100 conversations or 10,000 emails out of the way before tweaking it. Get testing."

Example application:
- Run at least 100 new-client conversations before changing ad creative.

### 100M Money Models - Recurring Revenue Reality (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Money Models, p. 103: "Good gyms have lots of recurring revenue. I had none."

Example application:
- Use BAMFAM + membership to stabilize refill revenue.

## Example Outputs (From This Case)
- BAMFAM: book next refill at checkout
- Pricing: peak-day premium, weekday discount
- Spend: increase to 1%-3% of revenue with attribution
- Training: managers shift to training + QA
