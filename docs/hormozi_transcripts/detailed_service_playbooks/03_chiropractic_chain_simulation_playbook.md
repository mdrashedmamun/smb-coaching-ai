## How to Use This
This is a reproducible teardown playbook. Follow the steps in order, collect the minimum inputs, and produce the outputs exactly as written. If you use assumptions, log them and label the result as scenario.

## Business Snapshot (Verbatim Anchors)
- "we currently have six brick and mortar locations trilling 12 months Revenue 5.2 million" [0:22]
- "net profit is about 23%" [0:28]
- "our packages can range from 2400 to 3600" [2:08]
- "we're getting about 35 leads uh per month" [3:01]
- "we have a show rate about 80%" [3:07]
- "our closing rate is about 71%" [3:13]
- "healthy close rate percentage is usually like 30 to 40%" [3:32]
- "number one I would say is probably lead flow" [3:50]
- "sales infrastructure because we are 75% insurance-based" [4:31]
- "CAC is about 700 our lifetime value is 3,400" [5:16]
- "increase Google spend" [38:05]
- "add in local SEO" [39:30]

## Required Inputs (Minimum to Simulate)
- Number of locations and per-location revenue/profit
- Offer structure and package pricing
- Lead volume per location and show/close rates
- CAC, LTV, and channel performance
- Insurance vs cash mix
- Sales process steps and verification workflow
- Staffing/ops variance by location

## Derived Metrics (From Transcript Numbers)
- LTV:CAC: 3,400 / 700 = 4.8:1
- Lead-to-sale: ~20 sales / 35 leads = ~57% (as stated, 71% close from shows)
- Profit margin: 23% (stated)

## Step-by-Step Teardown Process

### Step 1: Validate Economics and Identify Scaling Constraint
Goal: Confirm unit economics and locate the bottleneck.

Evidence:
- "net profit is about 23%" [0:28]
- "number one I would say is probably lead flow" [3:50]

Decision rule:
- If unit economics are healthy and close rates are high, focus on lead volume and channel scaling.

Output:
- Constraint statement: "Lead flow is the primary bottleneck; economics are solid."

### Step 2: Pressure-Test Pricing vs Close Rate
Goal: Determine if prices are too low given high close rates.

Evidence:
- "our closing rate is about 71%" [3:13]
- "healthy close rate percentage is usually like 30 to 40%" [3:32]

Decision rule:
- If close rates are significantly above 40%, test a higher price point or stronger front-end offer.

Output:
- Pricing test plan with controlled A/B across locations.

### Step 3: Expand High-Intent Channels First (Google + Local SEO)
Goal: Scale channels with strongest ROAS and intent.

Evidence:
- "increase Google spend" [38:05]
- "add in local SEO" [39:30]
- "I have a machine that I can put a dollar in and get $24 back" (Google ROAS discussion) [7:15]

Decision rule:
- If ROAS is high on Google, scale spend before experimenting with new channels.

Output:
- Budget shift plan: Google + SEO first, then Facebook.

### Step 4: Reduce Lead Leakage in Discovery Process
Goal: Preserve high show rates by front-loading key steps.

Evidence:
- "we have to verify their benefits" [4:37]
- "we should... get the templates already ready to go" [25:11]

Decision rule:
- If insurance verification delays sales, move verification earlier in the process.

Output:
- Updated intake workflow: insurance card capture -> template prep -> same-day plan.

### Step 5: Introduce a Low-Ticket Entry Offer
Goal: Increase show rates and secure commitment.

Evidence:
- "offering $19 $29... first consult or free x-ray" [18:59]
- "getting somebody to get a $29 credit card purchased... secures their spot" [23:54]

Decision rule:
- If no-show risk exists, require a low-ticket commitment to increase attendance.

Output:
- $29 consult/x-ray offer with card-on-file policy.

### Step 6: Sell at the Point of Greatest Pain
Goal: Reorder the sales flow for higher conversion.

Evidence:
- "sell at the point of greatest pain" [20:07]
- "if they come in pain... sell the package" [22:13]

Decision rule:
- If patients are most motivated before treatment, sell plan before relief is delivered.

Output:
- Sales sequence: assessment -> plan -> close -> treatment.

### Step 7: Normalize Ops Across Locations
Goal: Reduce variance in CAC and LTV by standardizing execution.

Evidence:
- "Kent... lowest CAC by a decent margin" [6:24]
- "culture of that team is really good" [6:41]

Decision rule:
- If location-level variance is high, replicate best-performing team standards.

Output:
- Ops playbook based on best clinic metrics.

### Step 8: Final Growth Physics Brief (Simulation Output)
Output should include:
- Primary constraint and pricing test plan
- Channel allocation and scale plan
- Intake workflow improvements
- Entry offer design
- Sales sequence change
- Ops standardization plan

## Book Frameworks Applied (With Examples)

### 100M Offers - Value Equation (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Offers, p. 61: "the goal should be to charge as much money for your products or services as humanly possible."
- 100M Offers, p. 43: "The degree of the pain will be proportional to the price you will be able to charge"

Example mapping:
- Patients in acute pain tolerate higher package pricing; sell before relief to maximize perceived value.

### 100M Leads - Lead Magnet Discipline (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Leads, p. 48: "A lead magnet is a complete solution to a narrow problem."

Example lead magnet:
- "$29 spinal decompression assessment" as a narrow, high-intent entry offer.

### 100M Money Models - Discount Rule (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Money Models, p. 46: "make your core offer discount equal to 10%-30% of your gross margins."

Example application:
- Apply discount to the $2,400-$3,600 package only within the gross margin window to protect cash.

## Example Outputs (From This Case)
- Lead focus: scale Google + SEO first
- Entry offer: $29 consult/x-ray to boost show rate
- Sales change: close before treatment relief
- Ops: replicate Kent clinic standards across locations

## Simulation Checklist (Copy/Paste)
1) Record per-location revenue, CAC, LTV, and close rates.
2) Test pricing if close rate > 40%.
3) Scale Google + SEO before other channels.
4) Add $19-$29 entry offer to secure attendance.
5) Reorder sales to sell before relief.
6) Normalize ops using best-performing clinic.
7) Produce Growth Physics Brief output.
