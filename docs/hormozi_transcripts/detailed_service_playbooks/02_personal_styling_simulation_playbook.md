## How to Use This
This is a reproducible teardown playbook. Follow the steps in order, collect the minimum inputs, and produce the outputs exactly as written. If you use assumptions, log them and label the result as scenario.

## Business Snapshot (Verbatim Anchors)
- "Revenue we make about 309,000 annually" [0:31]
- "130,000 in profits that gives us about 42% in net margins" [0:37]
- "business has recurring or reoccurring Revenue" [3:02]
- "8,500 bucks that's over the course of 60 days then it goes into either monthly at 2K a month or quarterly at 4500 a" [3:26]
- "I like to understand what percentage of customers are coming from every source" [4:31]
- "we're looking at about 12 total leads eight appointments 100% show for those appointments total sales four" [5:00]
- "close ratees 50% show ratees 100% 40 clients currently" [5:07]
- "Blended CAC of 600 um LTV is 10K annually so that gives us a 16 to1 LTV to CAC ratio" [6:56]
- "the fact that she's only lost one customer over a year out of 40" [7:16]
- "when I saw 1,800 Clicks in eight sales it was clearly a conversion issue" [8:03]
- "for a lead magnet to be really valuable we want it to be risk-free easy and fast" [20:37]
- "we want to have an exceptional lead magnet" [21:48]
- "you should be able to get like 30% of people to op in" [22:36]

## Required Inputs (Minimum to Simulate)
- Target avatar definition (age, income, life stage, triggers)
- Current revenue, profit, and net margin
- Offer ladder (onboarding + continuity prices)
- Lead sources with volume and conversion by channel
- CAC and LTV (annual or lifetime)
- Show rate and close rate
- Current client count and churn
- Capacity model (stylist supply and delivery constraints)

## Derived Metrics (From Transcript Numbers)
- Net margin: 130,000 / 309,000 = 42%
- Lead to sale: 4 sales / 12 leads = 33%
- Appointment to sale: 4 sales / 8 appointments = 50%
- Churn: 1 / 40 = 2.5% annual churn (stated as 1 lost out of 40)
- LTV:CAC: 10,000 / 600 = 16:1

## Step-by-Step Teardown Process

### Step 1: Confirm Core Economics Are Healthy
Goal: Ensure the model works before scaling demand.

Evidence:
- "130,000 in profits... 42% in net margins" [0:37]
- "Blended CAC of 600 um LTV is 10K annually" [6:56]

Decision rule:
- If LTV:CAC >= 3:1 and churn is low, the bottleneck is lead volume, not economics.

Output:
- Economics status: "Healthy; scale demand."

### Step 2: Define the Primary Avatar and Trigger
Goal: Focus the offer and lead magnet to a clear buyer.

Evidence:
- "I think what I want to do is break this down in terms of who" [15:16]
- Trigger examples: "I had a baby... I got divorced... I'm getting... my image doesn't match my status" [10:54]

Decision rule:
- Choose the 1-2 highest LTV avatars and define their trigger moments.

Output:
- Avatar definition + trigger list.

### Step 3: Audit Source Mix and Double Down
Goal: Allocate effort to the best channels.

Evidence:
- "I like to understand what percentage of customers are coming from every source" [4:31]

Decision rule:
- If a channel is under-resourced relative to contribution, reallocate time and budget.

Output:
- Channel mix table + focus channel.

### Step 4: Fix Conversion Leakage with a Lead Magnet
Goal: Convert high-intent traffic before asking for a call.

Evidence:
- "when I saw 1,800 Clicks in eight sales it was clearly a conversion issue" [8:03]
- "for a lead magnet to be really valuable we want it to be risk-free easy and fast" [20:37]
- "we want to have an exceptional lead magnet" [21:48]
- "you should be able to get like 30% of people to op in" [22:36]

Decision rule:
- If clicks are high and sales are low, add a lead magnet and measure opt-in rate.

Output:
- Lead magnet options:
  - Color palette guide based on skin/hair/eye tone
  - One perfect outfit example for a defined persona
  - Complimentary style assessment (qualified only)

### Step 5: Structure the Funnel to Pre-Sell
Goal: Move sales explanation before the call.

Evidence:
- "there's no incentive... click here schedule call and basically buy" [8:09]
- "I just try to put as much of that before the call" [25:33]

Decision rule:
- If calls repeat the same pitch, move core education to a pre-call video.

Output:
- Funnel steps: lead magnet -> opt-in -> pre-call video -> scheduler -> call.

### Step 6: Expand Affiliate Acquisition
Goal: Scale a high-leverage channel.

Evidence:
- "Affiliates are independent businesses that tell their audience to buy your stuff" [11:39]
- "only six people... send her a third of her business" [13:06]

Decision rule:
- If a small affiliate base drives a large share, expand the affiliate network.

Output:
- Affiliate scaling target: 6 -> 60 partners.

### Step 7: Strengthen Continuity and Capacity
Goal: Maintain recurring revenue and delivery quality.

Evidence:
- "business has recurring or reoccurring Revenue" [3:02]
- "40 clients currently" [5:07]

Decision rule:
- If churn is low, prioritize capacity expansion before aggressive lead scaling.

Output:
- Capacity plan: stylist hiring, training, and process standardization.

### Step 8: Final Growth Physics Brief (Simulation Output)
Output should include:
- Avatar and trigger definition
- Lead magnet and funnel steps
- Channel allocation plan
- Affiliate expansion plan
- Continuity and capacity plan
- Updated demand targets

## Book Frameworks Applied (With Examples)

### 100M Offers - Value Equation (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Offers, p. 62: "1. (Yay) The Dream Outcome (Goal: Increase)"
- 100M Offers, p. 62: "4. (Boo) Perceived Effort & Sacrifice (Goal: Decrease)"

Example mapping for a style assessment lead magnet:
- Dream outcome: look confident and status-aligned within 30 days
- Likelihood: stylist-backed guidance and before/after examples
- Time delay: immediate palette or outfit guidance
- Effort/sacrifice: done-for-you recommendations vs DIY checklists

### 100M Leads - Lead Magnet Discipline (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Leads, p. 48: "A lead magnet is a complete solution to a narrow problem."

Example lead magnet:
- "Your exact color palette in 5 minutes" (fast, narrow, low effort).

### 100M Money Models - Recurring Revenue Reality (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Money Models, p. 103: "Good gyms have lots of recurring revenue. I had none."

Example application:
- Protect and grow continuity by making ongoing styling sessions feel essential, not optional.

## Example Outputs (From This Case)
- Avatar: high-income women in transition (post-baby, divorce, career jump)
- Lead magnet: color palette guide + quick wardrobe wins
- Funnel: opt-in -> video -> call
- Affiliate scale: 6 partners to 60
- Demand target: improve opt-in to 30% on high-intent search

## Simulation Checklist (Copy/Paste)
1) Record revenue, net margin, CAC, LTV, churn, and lead sources.
2) Define top 1-2 avatars and their trigger moments.
3) Add a lead magnet and measure opt-in rate (target 30%).
4) Move core pitch to pre-call video.
5) Expand affiliates from 6 to 60.
6) Scale capacity before large ad spend.
7) Produce Growth Physics Brief output.
