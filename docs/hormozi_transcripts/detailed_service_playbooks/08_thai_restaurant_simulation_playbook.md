## How to Use This
This is a reproducible teardown playbook. Follow the steps in order, collect the minimum inputs, and produce the outputs exactly as written. If you use assumptions, log them and label the result as scenario.

## Business Snapshot (Verbatim Anchors)
- "2024, our revenue was 3.5 million." [0:42]
- "our net margins was 19%" [0:46]
- "we also do beer and wine, but it's only 1% of our sales." [2:44]
- "word of mouth is a big thing for us" [3:35]
- "the first one first is to increase the sales during the non- peak hour" [5:05]
- "increase alcohol sales, increase takeout sales" [6:03]
- "number one, we can increase sales during non- peak hours by actually changing pricing during peak hours" [6:21]
- "not to give discounts. Basically, it's either full price or it's free." [6:46]
- "We like to give free items instead of giving percentages off." [6:40]
- "There's going to be a really big opportunity there." [7:35]
- "nail it then scale it" [8:53]
- "we soft open" [9:38]

## Required Inputs (Minimum to Simulate)
- Revenue, net margin, and seat capacity
- Average ticket size (weekday vs weekend)
- Takeout vs dine-in mix
- Alcohol sales mix
- Peak vs off-peak traffic windows
- Current promotion strategy
- Staffing and server upsell training
- Expansion plan details (new location timeline)

## Derived Metrics (From Transcript Numbers)
- Net margin: 19% (stated)
- Alcohol sales mix: 1% of revenue (stated)
- Takeout mix: 30% takeout / 70% dine-in [2:39]

## Step-by-Step Teardown Process

### Step 1: Confirm Core Product Strength
Goal: Ensure product quality is the engine of growth.

Evidence:
- "word of mouth is a big thing for us" [3:35]
- "the food sale itself" [3:47]

Decision rule:
- If word of mouth is dominant, prioritize operational consistency before scaling.

Output:
- Product quality confirmed as growth engine.

### Step 2: Fix Off-Peak Utilization with Peak Pricing
Goal: Shift demand and raise average ticket.

Evidence:
- "increase the sales during the non- peak hour" [5:05]
- "change pricing during peak hours" [6:21]

Decision rule:
- If weekends are packed, raise peak prices and shift demand to weekdays via discounts or bundles.

Output:
- Peak pricing schedule + weekday incentive plan.

### Step 3: Increase Alcohol Attach Rate
Goal: Convert high-margin category from 1% to meaningful share.

Evidence:
- "beer and wine... only 1% of our sales" [2:44]
- "There's going to be a really big opportunity there." [7:35]

Decision rule:
- If alcohol mix is <5%, implement server scripts and menu placement changes.

Output:
- Alcohol attach strategy + staff training checklist.

### Step 4: Expand Takeout Revenue
Goal: Grow off-premise without degrading dine-in.

Evidence:
- "increase takeout sales" [6:03]

Decision rule:
- If takeout is already 30%, optimize packaging, pickup flow, and upsell.

Output:
- Takeout optimization plan.

### Step 5: Replace Discounts with Free Item Strategy
Goal: Protect brand positioning while driving trial.

Evidence:
- "not to give discounts. Basically, it's either full price or it's free." [6:46]
- "We like to give free items instead of giving percentages off." [6:40]

Decision rule:
- If discounts risk brand damage, use free-item promos instead.

Output:
- Free-item promo playbook for holidays and weekday traffic.

### Step 6: Nail-It-Then-Scale Expansion Discipline
Goal: Ensure second location replicates the model.

Evidence:
- "nail it then scale it" [8:53]
- "we soft open" [9:38]

Decision rule:
- If opening a new location, soft-open until ops are stable.

Output:
- Expansion sequencing plan: soft open -> stabilize -> grand opening.

### Step 7: Final Growth Physics Brief (Simulation Output)
Output should include:
- Peak/off-peak pricing plan
- Alcohol attach rate strategy
- Takeout growth plan
- Promo policy (free item vs discount)
- Expansion discipline steps

## Book Frameworks Applied (With Examples)

### 100M Offers - Dream Outcome (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Offers, p. 62: "1. (Yay) The Dream Outcome (Goal: Increase)"

Example mapping:
- Guest outcome: premium dining experience with faster seating and bar service.

### 100M Leads - Core Offer First (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Leads, p. 48: "Advertising your core offer might be all you need to get leads to engage. Try this way first."

Example application:
- Use best-selling dishes and reviews as core offer ads.

### 100M Money Models - Discount Rule (Applied)
Framework quote:
- 100M Money Models, p. 46: "make your core offer discount equal to 10%-30% of your gross margins."

Example application:
- If discounts are unavoidable, cap them within gross margin guardrails.

## Example Outputs (From This Case)
- Peak pricing on Thu-Sat, weekday incentives
- Alcohol attach target: >5% revenue
- Takeout: streamline pickup + upsell sides
- Expansion: soft open then scale

## Book Anchors (Direct Quotes)
- 100M Offers, p. 43: "The pain is the pitch."
- 100M Money Models, p. 46: "make your core offer discount equal to 10%-30% of your gross margins."
