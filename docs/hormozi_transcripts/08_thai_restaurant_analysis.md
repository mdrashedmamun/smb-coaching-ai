# 08 Thai Restaurant (52 min) - Analysis

## Snapshot
- Business: Thai restaurant
- Revenue: ~3.5M; Net margin: ~19%
- Average ticket: $60-$80; alcohol is ~1% of sales
- Problems: non-peak hour sales, takeout, alcohol attach rate, second location readiness

## Alex's Diagnostic Flow (as observed)
1) Baseline economics: margin is good but mix is weak.
2) Identify high-margin gap (alcohol sales at 1%).
3) Prioritize constraints: non-peak hours -> alcohol -> takeout/attribution.
4) Enforce "nail it then scale it" before second location.

## Prescriptions (ordered)
- Increase weekday sales by adjusting pricing during peak hours.
- Train staff to sell alcohol and improve attach rate.
- Use free-item promotions (not discounts) to attract and convert.
- Engineer menu and server prompts to drive higher-margin items.
- Soft open second location; scale after model is proven.

## Verbatim Quotes (transcript)
- "Our net margins was 19%." [0:42]
- "it's only 1% of our sales." [2:44]
- "number one, we can increase sales during non- peak hours by actually changing pricing during peak hours." [6:21]
- "not to give discounts... it's either full price or it's free." [6:46]
- "nail it then scale it" [8:53]

## Book Connections
- 100M Offers: Bonus/offer framing (free item vs discount), pricing emphasis.
- 100M Leads: Word-of-mouth and referral flywheel as primary acquisition.
- 100M Money Models: Margin expansion via product mix and attach rate.

## Outcome Path (end point solution)
A margin-first expansion plan:
1) Fix weekday demand and alcohol attach rate.
2) Train staff and refine menu prompts.
3) Soft open second location only after unit economics are stable.
