# 01 Garbage Collection (69 min) - Analysis

## Snapshot
- Business: Residential trash, recycling, yard waste collection
- Revenue: 642,000
- Net profit: -151,000 (negative 23% margin)
- Customers: ~2,500
- Core issue stated: profitability + asset utilization + too many channels

## Alex's Diagnostic Flow (as observed)
1) Stakes and urgency: family risk and time pressure establish focus.
2) Scoreboard check: revenue, profit, margin, customers.
3) Avatar split: HOA vs scatter; two sales processes create dilution.
4) Offer economics: cash collected vs cost of delivery + CAC.
5) Channel focus: pick one avatar + one channel + one product to 1M.
6) Single lever plan: commission-only door-to-door scale if front-end cash works.

## Prescriptions (ordered)
- Choose one avatar and one main channel for near-term cashflow (scatter vs HOA). 
- Restructure the offer to collect enough upfront cash to cover:
  - cost of first-month delivery
  - sales commission
  - bin cost (financing/fees)
- Scale a commission-only door-to-door team once the offer covers cash outlay.
- Treat HOA as long-term efficiency play; prioritize near-term profitability first.

## Verbatim Quotes (transcript)
- "Our revenue is 642,000. Our net profit is -151,000." [0:18]
- "Our net margins are negative 23%." [0:26]
- "So what's the problem? We need to become profitable." [0:33]
- "we have two types of avatars. 50% are what we call scatter. The other 50% are HOAs." [2:12]
- "I think what we're going to do is I think we're going to go avatar... then offer... then acquisition channel." [18:44]
- "I like having one avatar, one channel, one product up to a million dollars or more." [19:18]

- "if only that one thing were true then what are the other need to believe." [23:42]

## Book Connections
- 100M Offers: Value Equation and pricing logic underpin the offer restructure.
- 100M Leads: Channel focus (one avatar, one channel) before scaling.
- 100M Money Models: Cash collected must cover COGS + CAC early; front-end cash solves unit economics.

## Outcome Path (end point solution)
A cashflow-positive door-to-door growth loop:
1) Pick scatter as near-term avatar.
2) Fix the offer to collect enough cash upfront.
3) Hire commission-only reps and scale door-to-door.
4) Reinvest for efficiency; revisit HOA later once profitable.
