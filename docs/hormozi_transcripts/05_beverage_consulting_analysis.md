# 05 Beverage Consulting (57 min) - Analysis

## Snapshot
- Business: Cocktail/menu consulting for restaurants and bars
- Revenue: ~1.1M; Profit: ~123k; Net margin: ~11.3%
- Core offer: 30,000; Upsell rate: <20%
- CAC: ~11,800; LTV:CAC: ~1.7:1
- Core issues: offer mismatch, inconsistent lead flow, high CAC

## Alex's Diagnostic Flow (as observed)
1) Offer and pricing check (high-ticket offer to cold market).
2) Funnel + CAC review: cost too high for LTV.
3) Avatar narrowing to reduce unqualified leads.
4) Sequence: offer -> funnel -> ads -> sales -> ascension.

## Prescriptions (ordered)
- Fix offer/market fit before scaling ads.
- Narrow avatar to higher-value, qualified operators.
- Rebuild funnel with aligned lead magnet and pre-sell assets.
- Improve sales process and ascension path (core -> retainer).

## Verbatim Quotes (transcript)

- "A $12,000 uh CAC is crazy." [4:29]
- "there's definitely an offer mismatch between what is being advertised and what they're selling" [4:47]
- "I think that we need to actually talk about the offer... then the funnel... and then sales." [3:33]
