# 08 Thai Restaurant (52 min) - Detailed Analysis

## Snapshot
- Business: Thai restaurant
- Revenue: ~3.5M; Net margin: ~19%
- Average ticket: $60-$80; alcohol is ~1% of sales
- Problems: non-peak hour sales, takeout, alcohol attach rate, second location readiness

## Alex's Diagnostic Flow (as observed)
1) Baseline economics: margins are good but mix is weak.
2) Identify high-margin gap (alcohol attach rate).
3) Prioritize constraints: non-peak hours -> alcohol -> takeout/attribution.
4) Enforce "nail it then scale it" before second location.

## Prescriptions (ordered)
- Increase weekday sales by adjusting peak-hour pricing.
- Train staff to sell alcohol and improve attach rate.
- Use free-item promotions (not discounts) to attract and convert.
- Engineer menu and server prompts to drive higher-margin items.
- Soft open the new location; scale only after model is stable.

## Connection Notes
