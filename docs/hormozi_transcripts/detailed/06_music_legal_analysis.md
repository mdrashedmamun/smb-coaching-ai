# 06 Music Legal Services (Failing Business) - Detailed Analysis

## Snapshot
- Business: Legal services + education + software for Latin music artists
- Revenue: ~300,000; Loss: ~100,000
- Profitable unit: services; losses in education + software
- Main lead source: YouTube -> Instagram DMs

## Alex's Diagnostic Flow (as observed)
1) Financial triage: identify which units make/lose money.
2) Channel reality check: sales happen in DMs, not website.
3) Funnel rebuild around what already works (IG DMs).
4) Qualification upgrade (BANT) and outcome-based pricing.

## Prescriptions (ordered)
- Route all CTAs to Instagram DMs (primary sales channel).
- Book calls without pay, then sell outcome-based packages.
- Use BANT qualification and a short VSL before calls.
- Raise pricing and segment service vs education clearly.
