## Alex's Diagnostic Flow (as observed)
1) Stakes and urgency: family pressure and time sensitivity.
2) Scoreboard: revenue, profit, margin, customer count.
3) Avatar split: HOA vs scatter creates two sales motions.
4) Offer economics: cash collected vs cost of delivery + CAC + commission.
5) Channel focus: one avatar, one channel, one product to 1M.
6) Single-lever plan: commission-only door-to-door scale if front-end cash works.

## Prescriptions (ordered)
- Choose one avatar for near-term cashflow (scatter vs HOA).
- Restructure offer to collect enough upfront cash to cover:
  - first-month delivery cost
  - sales commission
  - bin cost financing
- Scale a commission-only door-to-door team once unit economics work.
- Treat HOA as a longer-term efficiency play after cashflow is stable.
