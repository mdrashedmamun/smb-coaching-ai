# 06 Music Legal Services (Failing Business) - Analysis

## Snapshot
- Business: Legal services + education + software for Latin music artists
- Revenue: ~300,000; Loss: ~100,000
- Profitable unit: services; losses in education + software
- Main lead source: YouTube -> Instagram DMs

## Alex's Diagnostic Flow (as observed)
1) Financial triage: identify losing units and profitable unit.
2) Channel reality check: sales happening in DMs, not website.
3) Funnel rebuild around what already works (IG DMs).
4) Qualification upgrade (BANT) and outcome-based pricing.

## Prescriptions (ordered)
- Route all CTAs to Instagram DMs (where sales already occur).
- Book calls without pay, then sell outcome-based packages.
- Use BANT qualification and a short VSL before calls.
- Raise pricing significantly and segment service vs education.

## Verbatim Quotes (transcript)
- "Our revenue over the last 12 months has been 300,000... We lost a 100,000." [0:22]
- "The place that you don't intend people to go is where you make your money." [2:41]
- "all of the CTAs here are DM me on Instagram." [14:39]
- "we're going to sell them a package... charge you for the outcome." [15:03]
- "budget, authority, need, timing." [16:51]
- "I would love you to charge 5,000." [18:00]

## Book Connections
- 100M Offers: Outcome-based pricing and value-based positioning.
- 100M Leads: Channel focus and qualification before conversion.
- 100M Money Models: Unit economics and product line pruning.

## Outcome Path (end point solution)
A channel-accurate monetization reset:
1) Push all traffic to IG DMs.
2) Qualify using BANT.
3) Sell outcome-based packages at higher price points.
4) Use education as a down-sell for unqualified leads.
