# Course Material Part A

## Module 1: Diagnose Existing Offers

### 1. Reality Check — The Amplification Trap
*   **Concept**: Great marketing cannot fix a broken offer. If you amplify a weak offer, you just show flaws to more people.
*   **Symptoms**: Leads ghost, sales calls go nowhere, marketing budgets vanish.

### 2. Case Studies (Aisha & Daniel)
*   **Aisha (Skincare)**: Beautiful product, confused message. "Herbal skincare" (Feature) vs. "Clear skin in 30 days" (Outcome).
*   **Daniel (Marketing)**: "SEO Strategy Workshop" (Feature) vs. "22 Leads in 14 Days" (Outcome).

### 3. The Fix (Interactive Steps)
1.  **Audience Precision**: Defined exactly who it is for (e.g., "Women 20-35 looking to switch from chemicals").
2.  **Pain Point Mapping**: Moved from surface features to deep frustrations.
3.  **Outcome shift**: Feature -> Result.
4.  **Cut the Clutter**: Remove jargon, focus on the "One Thing".

### 4. FAQ & Objections
*   "What if I'm not sure?" -> Test on 5 people.
*   "Afraid of bold claims?" -> If it works, you *owe* it to them to be clear.
*   "Saturated industry?" -> Specificity cuts through noise.

## Module 2: Diagnose Lead-to-Sales Cycle

### 1. Reality Check — The Leaky Bucket
*   **Concept**: More leads won't fix a broken process. You need to plug the leaks first.
*   **Symptoms**: DMs don't convert, proposals go silent, "Let me think about it".

### 2. Case Studies
*   **Aisha**: Treated every DM as a buyer. No filter. No tracking.
*   **Daniel**: Took calls with everyone. Passive follow-up.

### 3. The Fix (Interactive Steps)
1.  **Filtering**: Add 3 screening questions (Budget, Timeline, Seriousness).
2.  **Tracking**: Google Sheet / Simple CRM. "Nothing gets lost".
3.  **Active Follow-up**: Day 1, 3, 7 rule.
4.  **Action Plan**: 21-day plan to fix the leaks.

### 4. FAQ
*   "I don't have a process" -> You do, it's just unstructured.
*   "Pushy?" -> Not if it's helpful.
*   "No time?" -> 5 minutes of tracking saves hours of chaos.
