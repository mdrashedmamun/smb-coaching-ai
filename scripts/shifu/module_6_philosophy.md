# Module 6: Reliability Protocol — Behavioral Spec
> Master Shifu's Contract | Owner: Philosophy Layer

---

## 1. The Belief Under Attack

> "I have to do everything myself. No one can do it as well as me."

This is not a time-management problem. This is an **identity trap**. The founder's self-worth is entangled with being indispensable. Breaking the Labor Ceiling requires breaking this belief first.

---

## 2. The Resistance Being Confronted

- **Fear of delegation** disguised as "quality standards."
- **Identity attachment** to being essential ("If I don't do it, it won't be done right.").
- **The quiet pride of exhaustion** ("I work harder than anyone.").
- **Loss aversion**: Delegating feels like giving up control, not gaining capacity.

The system must name this resistance without preaching. It should feel like a mirror, not a lecture.

---

## 3. The Emotional Arc

| Stage | Internal State | System Action |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| **1. Recognition** | "I am spending $X/yr on work a VA could do." | Time Audit + Cost of Chaos calculation. |
| **2. Discomfort** | "I have to pick *one*. I can't fix everything." | Force single-task selection. Lock others. |
| **3. Forced Tradeoff** | "This single task is my most expensive mistake." | SOP Extraction (crude, 7-step max). |
| **4. Relief / Commitment** | "Delegating this unlocks Y hours and $Z capacity." | Freedom Dashboard + "Mark as Delegated". |

The arc is designed to be **uncomfortable but actionable**. No step should feel optional. No step should allow the user to feel clever without committing.

---

## 4. Definition of Done (Behavioral, Not Informational)

| ❌ NOT This | ✅ THIS |
|-------------|---------|
| "User understands delegation is important." | "User has named one task, documented it crudely, and clicked 'Mark as Delegated'." |
| "User has learned about SOPs." | "User has created a handoff document they can send TODAY." |
| "User feels motivated." | "User has capacity unlocked and `labor_ceiling` score reduced." |

**Systemic Effect:** Completing this module must mutate the global `labor_ceiling` score. The constraint weakens. This is not gamification—it's consequence.

---

## 5. Anti-Patterns (What This Module Must NOT Become)

- ❌ A course on delegation.
- ❌ A template library ("here are 50 SOP examples").
- ❌ A best-practices checklist.
- ❌ Something that feels "educational" instead of "surgical."
- ❌ A moral lecture about "working smarter, not harder."
- ❌ A feature that rewards completion without commitment.

**Guiding Rule:** If the user can finish the module *without* making a real decision, the module is broken.

## 6. Psychological Load Test Criteria

Before this module is considered "done," a human must run it adversarially:

- [ ] Can I minimize the "Cost of Chaos" by lying about hours? (If yes, do we care?)
- [ ] Can I pick a "safe" task that doesn't actually hurt to delegate?
- [ ] Can I rush the SOP without actually thinking about the handoff?
- [ ] Does clicking "Mark as Delegated" feel like a checkbox or a line I've crossed?

**Pass Condition:** The system should feel like a mirror, not an ambush. Discomfort should be subtle, controlled, and unavoidable.

---

## 7. Reusability as Template

This document structure is the **canonical pattern** for all future "Cure" modules.

Every module must define:
1. Belief Under Attack
2. Resistance Being Confronted
3. Emotional Arc
4. Behavioral Definition of Done
5. Anti-Patterns
6. Psychological Load Test Criteria

Without this, modules will drift into content delivery. With it, they remain decision infrastructure.
