# Strategy Briefing: Boring SMBs
> Single source of truth for new joiners (10-15 min read)

## Executive Summary

We build for **boring, high-ticket service SMBs** to make them **operationally predictable and fundable**.

**How it works:**
1. Identify one operational constraint at a time
2. Force real behavioral change
3. Accept progress only when costly to reverse
4. Monitor daily whether that change still holds

**Two principles anchor everything:**
- **Irreversibility Rule:** A behavior only counts if reversing it causes real operational pain.
- **Daily Reliance (Toothbrush Test):** The product must be used daily to confirm nothing has quietly regressed.

## 1. Target Customer (Locked)

| Attribute | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Revenue | $300K–$5M/year |
| Price Point | $2,000+ per engagement |
| Delivery | Human-intensive, expertise-based |
| Team | Solo to 10 FTEs |
| Founder Role | **Primary bottleneck** (delivery, sales, or decisions) |
| Revenue Dependency | Relies on founder availability |

**IN:** Consultants, Agencies, Professional Services, Coaches who are the product.
**OUT:** SaaS, E-commerce, VC-backed, teams with managerial redundancy.

## 2. The Problem We Solve

These businesses are not failing. They are **fragile**.
- Founder does too much
- Decisions made but not enforced
- Delegation exists on paper, not reality
- Revenue stability erodes quietly

**Root issue:** Lack of enforced follow-through.

---

## 3. The Core Gap We Fixed

The system allowed **intent to masquerade as execution**.
- Tasks marked "delegated" without anyone else doing them
- SOPs existing without being used
- Cadences planned without being sustained

**This is acceptable for coaching. Unacceptable for underwriting.**

## 4. Strategic Principle #1: Irreversibility Rule

> A behavior only counts if reversing it causes operational pain.

**Evidence Levels:**
| Level | What It Means | Fundability Claim? |
|---|---|---|
| Bronze | Time-based rechecks | ❌ No |
| Silver | Partial delegation with monitoring | 🟡 Maybe |
| Gold | Someone else executed, founder uninvolved | ✅ Yes |

We do not overclaim Bronze as underwriting-grade.

## 5. Strategic Principle #2: Daily Reliance (Toothbrush Test)

**Daily use does NOT mean:**
- New insights every day
- New decisions every day

**Daily use means:**
> Confirming that yesterday's decisions still hold today.

**The daily unit of value is regression detection:**
- Did a delegated task come back to the founder?
- Did a cadence break?
- Did a constraint slip?

The product acts as a **monitor**, not a planner.

---

## 6. How the Two Principles Work Together

| Principle | Ensures... |
|---|---|
| Irreversibility | Progress is real |
| Daily Reliance | Progress stays real |

- Without irreversibility → daily use becomes noise
- Without daily use → irreversibility decays silently

**Both are required.**

---

## 7. Product Design Rules

1. **One constraint at a time** (externally). Track many internally.
2. **No feature ships without:** an irreversibility mechanism + regression detection.
3. **Diagnostics are entry points, not outcomes.**
4. **Ornamental features (branding, AI copy) deferred** until delivery is consistent.

---

## 8. What We Sell

**NOT:** Growth, Optimization, Insights.
**YES:** Predictability, Behavioral Credibility, Reduced Downside Risk.

That is what lenders trust, accelerators screen for, and ethical finance requires.

---

## Final Grounding Statement

This product converts **human behavior in small service businesses** into **observable, repeatable, credible operational signals**.

- Irreversibility ensures signals are real.
- Daily reliance ensures they stay real.

If either weakens, the product becomes performative.
If both are enforced, the product becomes infrastructure.

**That is the strategy.**
