```
Traffic → Free Value Asset → Application → Sales Call → Client
```

## The 8 Core Funnel Principles

### Principle #1: One Bottleneck at a Time

> "We built all of these different pieces in order and to solve one specific bottleneck."

- Do NOT try to build the entire system tomorrow
- Identify your current bottleneck (traffic, conversion, close rate, retention)
- Build ONE thing to solve that bottleneck
- Then move to the next

**For high-ticket services:**
- If you have no leads → fix traffic/outreach first
- If you have leads but no calls → fix the application/booking process
- If you have calls but no closes → fix the sales conversation
- If you close but churn → fix delivery/retention

### Principle #2: You Won't Get It Right the First Time

> "You have no idea how many times we have rewritten a landing page, rebuilt an entire funnel, revised dozens of automations."

- Expect iteration
- Build for feedback loops
- The first version is never the final version

**For high-ticket services:**
- Your first sales script will need revision
- Your first intake form will miss questions
- Your first pricing will be wrong
- Accept this. Ship anyway. Iterate.

### Principle #3: The Boring Work Is the Moat

> "Most people are not willing to do the boring work of going through all the different iterations. Which is why we like to say that the boring work is the moat."

- Iteration is the advantage
- Willingness to redo the thing creates differentiation
- Competitors quit when it gets tedious

**For high-ticket services:**
- Competitors use generic proposals. You customize.
- Competitors do no follow-up. You follow up 5x.
- Competitors copy templates. You iterate based on data.

### Principle #4: Rule of One

> "Always sell the next step only. Do not make the mistake of selling or trying to sell more than one thing."

- One CTA per screen
- One action per email
- One goal per page
- Multi-step confusion kills conversion

**For high-ticket services:**
- Don't pitch pricing AND schedule AND download in one email
- Don't offer 3 packages on one proposal (or if you do, recommend one)
- Each touchpoint has ONE job

### Principle #5: Dynamic CTAs Based on Position

> "Our system calculates what's the next thing someone should be doing based on where they are at and what they just did."

- Not everyone is at the same stage
- Personalize the CTA based on their progress
- Meet them where they are

**For high-ticket services:**
- If they downloaded your guide but didn't apply → CTA: "Apply now"
- If they applied but didn't book → CTA: "Book your call"
- If they had a call but didn't close → CTA: Proposal follow-up
- If they're a client → CTA: Upsell/referral

### Principle #6: You're Not Following Up Enough

> "They received at least 90 emails before making the decision to join."

- The more follow-ups you send, the more money you make
- 99% of marketing is reminding busy people you exist
- Faulty belief: "I'm annoying them" → Truth: They're busy and forgot

**For high-ticket services:**
- Most founders send 1-2 follow-ups. Winners send 7-10.
- "I don't want to be annoying" = leaving money on the table
- Decision-makers are busy. They need reminders.

### Principle #7: 1% to 2% Is 100%

> "When you go from 1% conversion rate to 2%, you're not just adding a few thousand bucks. You're going from 1 million to 2 millions."

- Small conversion improvements compound massively
- Doubling conversion = doubling revenue
- Worth the boring work of optimization

**For high-ticket services:**
- Improving close rate from 20% to 25% = 25% more revenue
- Improving show rate from 60% to 80% = 33% more calls
- Small improvements across the funnel multiply

### Principle #8: Follow Up on Intent

> "How do you follow up with people who are engaged and are showing intent but are not really taking the next step?"

- Abandoned application: clicked but didn't finish
- Abandoned booking: clicked but didn't book
- No-show: booked but didn't show
- Stalled proposal: saw proposal but didn't respond

**For high-ticket services:**
- Every drop-off point needs a follow-up sequence
- "They'll reach out if they're interested" = false
- Intent without action = they need help/reminder

## The Email/Follow-Up Architecture

### 3 Types of Touchpoints

| Type | Goal | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Value** | Pure education, nurture | Case study, insight, framework |
| **Indirect** | Value + CTA nudge | "By the way, we have 2 spots open" |
| **Direct** | Straight CTA | "Ready to talk? Book here." |

### The Follow-Up System (Generalized)

| Sequence | Trigger | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| **Nurture Sequence** | Opted in | Give away strategy, build trust |
| **Application Follow-Up** | Applied but didn't book | Overcome objections |
| **Pre-Call Sequence** | Booked a call | Increase show rate + arrive prepared |
| **Abandoned Application** | Started but didn't finish | Re-engage |
| **Abandoned Booking** | Clicked book but didn't | Re-engage |
| **Proposal Follow-Up** | Sent proposal, no response | Close the loop |
| **Re-engagement** | Went cold | Wake up dead leads |
| **Newsletter** | Everyone | Nurture forever |

---

## The Pre-Call System (Maximize Show Rate)

| Touchpoint | Timing | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| **Confirmation** | Immediately | Confirm time, build credibility |
| **Introduction** | Day before | Introduce who they'll meet |
| **Reminder** | Morning of | Final reminder, link to prep material |
| **Strategy Brief** | Attached to all | Ensure they show up prepared |

## Application to Our Lead Bottleneck Engine

These principles apply directly to our product:

| Principle | Our Application |
|---|---|
| **4 Activation Points** | Intake → Audit → Prescription → Accountability Loop |
| **One Bottleneck at a Time** | Diagnose ONE bottleneck, prescribe ONE action |
| **Dynamic CTAs** | Calculate "next step" based on where founder is |
| **Follow Up on Intent** | If founder starts audit but doesn't finish → re-engage |
| **Rule of One** | Each screen has ONE action |
| **The Boring Work Is the Moat** | Willingness to iterate is our advantage |
| **1% to 2% is 100%** | Small improvements in founder behavior compound |
| **You Won't Get It Right First Time** | Expect iteration. Build for feedback loops. |

## What This Adds to Our PRD

### 1. Lead Bottleneck Verdict (Synthesis Screen)

We need a screen that:
- Synthesizes all inputs
- Shows the business model visually
- Delivers the verdict ("Your bottleneck is X")
- Presents path options ("You can do A or B")
- Delivers the prescription
- Connects to the Accountability Loop

### 2. Re-engagement System

We need follow-up mechanisms for:
- Started audit but didn't finish → Reminder
- Got prescription but didn't report → Follow-up
- Reported once but stopped → Re-engagement

### 3. Dynamic Next-Step Calculation

Based on where the founder is:
- If they haven't done audit → CTA: "Start your audit"
- If they did audit but no prescription → CTA: "Get your prescription"
- If they have prescription → CTA: "Report your results"
