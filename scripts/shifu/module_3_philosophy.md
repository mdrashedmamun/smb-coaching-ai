# Module 3: The Broken Rhythm — Behavioral Spec
> Master Shifu's Contract | Owner: Philosophy Layer

---

## 1. The Belief Under Attack

> "I just need more leads / more clients / more sales."

**Reality:** You don't need more. You need to show up consistently with what you have.

The founder believes growth solves fragility. But growth without rhythm accelerates collapse.

---

## 2. The Resistance Being Confronted

- **Shiny Object Syndrome:** Chasing new channels instead of maintaining existing ones.
- **Hero Mode:** "I'll just do an extra push this week" (unsustainable).
- **Invisibility of Slippage:** Missed follow-ups, broken cadences don't hurt *today*.
- **Overconfidence in Memory:** "I'll remember to post / call / follow up."

---

## 3. The Emotional Arc

| Stage | Internal State | System Action |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Recognition** | "I've been inconsistent for weeks." | Lead Audit surfaces cadence gaps. |
| **2. Cost Revelation** | "This is costing me $X in lost deals." | "Money Lost to Inconsistency" calculation. |
| **3. Forced Commitment** | "I will do *this one thing* on *this schedule*." | Rhythm Builder: 1 channel, 1 cadence. |
| **4. Daily Confirmation** | "Did yesterday's rhythm hold?" | Daily Check-in Modal: Regression detection. |

---

## 4. Definition of Done (Behavioral, Not Informational)

| ❌ NOT This | ✅ THIS |
|---|---|
| "User understands consistency matters." | "User committed to a specific action on a specific day." |
| "User created a content calendar." | "User executed the first beat AND system confirmed it." |
| "User feels motivated." | "User has Gold evidence of rhythm execution." |

**Systemic Effect:** Completing this module reduces the `distribution_weakness` score.

---

## 5. Anti-Patterns (What This Module Must NOT Become)

- ❌ A content calendar tool.
- ❌ A social media scheduler.
- ❌ A productivity app with daily reminders.
- ❌ Nagware that makes founders feel policed.
- ❌ A module that rewards *planning* over *executing*.

**Guiding Rule:** If the system confirms rhythm without external proof, it's broken.

---

## 6. Irreversibility Enforcement

| Action | Counts Only If... |
|---|---|
| "Commit to Rhythm" | First beat is executed AND externally observable. |
| "Rhythm Maintained" | System re-validates in 7 days with proof events. |
| Bronze → Silver → Gold | Only escalates with increasing external confirmation. |

---

## 7. Daily Reliance (Toothbrush Test)

**The daily question:**
> "Did you stick to the plan yesterday?"

This is NOT:
- A new task list
- A reminder to "do more"
- A motivational nudge

This IS:
- Regression detection
- Confirmation that constraints are stable
- Sub-2-minute check-in

**If the founder feels managed, we failed. If the founder feels protected, we succeeded.**

---

## 8. Language Gate (Hard Requirement)

All text in this module must pass the **3rd Grade Level** test.

- **No:** "Broken Rhythm Cost", "Cadence", "Evidence Level", "Protocol".
- **Yes:** "Money Lost", "Schedule", "Trust Score", "Plan".
- **Test:** Read it out loud. If it sounds like a bank, rewrite it.

---

## 9. Risk Mitigations (From User Context)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| False positives (alert when nothing broke) | Only trigger on observable regression, not time decay alone. |
| Founder fatigue | Sub-2-min check-in, focused on confirmation. |
| Dependency on Module 6 | Ensure Module 6 proof-of-handoff is working before shipping. |
| Bronze overclaimed as Gold | Clear UI labels. Fundability only for Gold. |
| Perceived as nagware | Position as "behavioral firewall", not productivity app. |
