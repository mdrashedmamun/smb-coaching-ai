# Master Shifu Layer
> Philosophy & Behavioral Architecture

This directory contains the **Non-Technical PRDs** for each module.

## Purpose
While `scripts/ralph/` owns the *technical* execution (inputs, outputs, formulas), **Master Shifu** owns the *behavioral* intent:

- What belief is being attacked?
- What resistance is being confronted?
- What emotional arc must the user traverse?
- What is the *behavioral* definition of done?

## The Two-Contract Model

| Layer | Owner | File | Purpose |
|-------|-------|------|---------|
| Technical | Ralph | `ralph/prd.json` | What the system *does*. |
| Behavioral | Shifu | `shifu/module_X_philosophy.md` | What the system *attacks*. |

## Files

- `module_6_philosophy.md` — Reliability Protocol (Labor Ceiling)
- *(Future)* `module_3_philosophy.md` — Lead Rhythm (Distribution)
- *(Future)* `module_1_philosophy.md` — Offer Diagnostic (Pricing Power)

## Guiding Principle

> "If the user can finish the module *without* making a real decision, the module is broken."

Every cure must force a tradeoff. Every tradeoff must reduce a constraint. No education without extraction.
