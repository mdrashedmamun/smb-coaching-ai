> Key insights captured during development

---

## Session: 2026-01-10 to 2026-01-11 (Phase 7.4 → 7.5 → Strategic Pivot)

### 1. Language Determines User Selection
- **Insight:** Metric-adjacent language (e.g., "LTV:CAC Optimizer", "Volatility Tax") attracts spreadsheet cosplayers who game systems.
- **Action:** Renamed "Volatility Tax" → "The Broken Rhythm". Instituted Language Gate in Manifesto.
- **Source:** Coach feedback.

### 2. Irreversibility Rule
- **Insight:** A behavior only counts if reversing it causes operational pain. Without this, founders click "Mark as Delegated" and quietly take tasks back.
- **Action:** Added Manifesto Section IX. Defined enforcement rules (proof-of-handoff, time decay, external execution).
- **Source:** Coach feedback.

### 3. Toothbrush Test = Regression Detection
- **Insight:** Daily use doesn't mean new insights daily. It means confirming yesterday's decisions still hold.
- **Action:** Created Strategy Briefing explaining this. Daily unit of value = "Did a constraint slip?"
- **Source:** Coach feedback reconciling Irreversibility with Toothbrush Test.

### 4. Evidence Levels (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- **Insight:** Not all proof is equal. Bronze (time-based rechecks) ≠ Gold (external execution, founder uninvolved).
- **Action:** Documented in Strategy Briefing. Only Gold is fundability-grade.
- **Source:** Coach feedback.

### 5. ICP: Founder-as-Bottleneck
- **Insight:** High-Ticket Service alone is insufficient. Must explicitly require "Founder is primary delivery/sales/decision bottleneck."
- **Action:** Updated Manifesto Section VIII with this constraint.
- **Source:** Coach feedback.

### 6. Behavior → Evidence → Metric (Never Inverted)
- **Insight:** If metrics lead behavior, users optimize for numbers. If behavior leads, metrics become receipts.
- **Action:** Added "Iron Law" to Manifesto Section VII.
- **Source:** Coach feedback.

## Pending Learnings (To Validate in Phase 7.6)

- [ ] Does "Broken Rhythm" detection work without feeling like nagware?
- [ ] Is sub-2-minute daily check-in achievable?
- [ ] Can we enforce Gold evidence without friction overload?
