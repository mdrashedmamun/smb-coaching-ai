## 1. The One-Line Test (Use First)
**Question:** If this didn’t exist, would money outcomes break or just feel worse?
- "Feel worse" → **Nice-to-Have** (DEFER)
- "Money outcomes degrade" → **Must-Have** (PROCEED)

---

## 2. MUST-HAVE Checklist (Non-Negotiable)
If ANY of these fail, the feature is rejected.

### 1. Direct Line to Money
- ✅ **Pass:** Prevents revenue loss, increases predictability, or reduces downside risk. (e.g., Missed rhythm = lost deals).
- ❌ **Fail:** Requires more than 2 sentences to explain the link to money.

### 2. Behavioral Enforcement (Not Advice)
- ✅ **Pass:** Forces an action (Constraint).
- ❌ **Fail:** Explains a best practice (Education).

### 3. Irreversibility Present
- ✅ **Pass:** Founder CANNOT undo this quietly next week without pain.
- ❌ **Fail:** Founder can revert silently.

### 4. Daily Toothbrush Touch
- ✅ **Pass:** Fits into a 15-60 second daily habit.
- ❌ **Fail:** Weekly review, monthly insight, or episodic usage.

### 5. Signal Quality Improves
- ✅ **Pass:** Produces Gold/Silver evidence for lenders/advisors.
- ❌ **Fail:** Produces self-awareness or insight only.

## 3. NICE-TO-HAVE Checklist (The Graveyard)
These are explicitly deferred.

- ❌ **Feels Smart:** Dashboards, scores, rankings that don't force action.
- ❌ **Adds Options:** More channels, workflows, choices.
- ❌ **Improves Expression:** Better copy, branding, positioning (BEFORE behavior is fixed).
- ❌ **Marketing Debt:** Built to make demos look impressive.

## 4. The Pressure Test (For Every PR/Epic)
Must answer ALL four:
1. What breaks financially if this doesn’t exist?
2. What human behavior does this force or prevent?
3. What evidence does this generate that couldn’t exist before?
4. What decision becomes impossible to avoid?

## 5. Drift Warning
**We are not building a productivity system.**
**We are building a filter.**

If a feature makes the product "nicer" but relaxes the filter, kill it.
