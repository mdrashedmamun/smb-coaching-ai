# The Antigravity Manifesto
> "We don't help you get money. We help you become fundable."

**New Joiner?** Start with the [Strategy Briefing](./strategy_briefing.md) (10-15 min read).

## I. Identity: What We Are Not
- **We are NOT a SaaS.** SaaS sells tools to manage problems. We build infrastructure to eliminate them.
- **We are NOT a Content Library.** If a user learns something but does nothing, we have failed.
- **We are NOT a Coach.** Coaches give advice. We provide mirrors.

## II. Identity: What We Are
We are **Decision Infrastructure**.
We are a **Behavioral Readiness Engine** for underwriting, not a replacement for it.
We are a **Pre-Finance Intelligence Layer**.

Our product is not the software; our product is the **Decisive Founder**.

---

## III. The Core Mechanism
The system operates on **Constraint Theory**, not Curriculum Theory.

1.  **Diagnosis:** Identify the single bottleneck.
2.  **Agitation:** Monetize the cost of that bottleneck (Cost of Chaos).
3.  **Extraction:** Force a crude, immediate tradeoff (SOP, Asset, Decision).
4.  **Mutation:** Update the global state (Score).

**The Rule of Pain:**
> "The system must be surgical, uncomfortable, and opinionated."
> If the founder feels clever *without acting*, we missed.
> If the founder feels urgent, we hit.

---

## IV. The Business Case (The Why)
We solve **Indecision Disguised as Busyness**.

1.  **For Founders:** A forced prioritization engine. "Stop doing $15/hr work."
2.  **For Capital (Lenders/Gov/Accelerators):** A risk-visibility layer. "Show me proof of execution."

**The Bridge to Ethical Finance:**
Capital wants to flow, but risk is invisible. We make risk legible.
We do not promise funding. We promise **readiness**.

**What We Measure:**
We do not measure morality, ambition, or worth.
We measure constraint clarity, execution evidence, and capacity unlocked.
These are signals, not verdicts.

---

## V. Anti-Patterns (The Drift)
The moment we do any of the following, we die:
- [ ] Add "educational videos" without a forced action.
- [ ] Soften the "Cost of Chaos" language to be nice.
- [ ] Reward login frequency instead of constraint reduction.
- [ ] Become a "wellness" tool.

## VI. The Operating Model (The Fundability Bridge)
We do not help founders get money. We help them convert "fuzzy chaos" into **Legible Risk**.

**Step 1: Constraint Diagnosis (Reality)**
- Input: Structured diagnostic.
- Output: **Single dominant constraint.** (e.g., Labor Ceiling). Costs calculated.

**Step 2: Behavioral Underwriting (The Differentiator)**
- Mechanism: Force ONE uncomfortable action.
- Rule: No education. Execution > Intention.
- Result: **Predictive Risk Data.**

**Step 3: Operational Evidence Generation**
- Activity: System captures proof of execution (SOP lineage, delegation trails).
- Goal: Replace "vibes" with evidence.

**Step 4: Financial Signal Normalization**
- Focus: Downside protection, not hockey sticks.
- Output: Cash flow visibility, un-cheatable risk ratios.

**Step 5: Fundability Score**
- A measure of **Decision Reliability**, not just credit.
- Used by: Lenders to filter deals, Accelerators to screen cohorts.

**Step 6: Capital Readiness Handoff**
- We stop here. We are the mirror, not the bank.
- Output: A Fundability Dossier.

## VII. Causal Order & Language Gate (Internal Discipline)

**The Iron Law:**
> **Behavior → Evidence → Metric. Never Inverted.**

Metrics may exist internally, but they are *receipts*, not *targets*.
If a user thinks "I need to improve this number," we have failed.
If a user thinks "Oh, that happened because of what I did," we have succeeded.

**The Language Gate (Naming Rules):**
Every module, feature, or metric label must describe:
- ✅ A **Human Failure Mode** (e.g., "Broken Rhythm", "Decision Thrash")
- ✅ A **Constraint** (e.g., "Labor Ceiling", "Founder Dependency")
- ✅ A **Tradeoff** (e.g., "The Most Expensive Mistake")

Never:
- ❌ A Ratio (e.g., "LTV:CAC Optimizer")
- ❌ A Score (e.g., "Growth Score")
- ❌ An Optimization Promise (e.g., "Efficiency Engine")

**Why This Matters:**
Language determines who self-selects into the product.
Metric-adjacent language attracts spreadsheet cosplayers who will game the system, corrupt data, and destroy lender trust.
Behavioral language attracts boring founders who want payroll to clear.

**Metric-Attracted Users Are a Risk, Not Leads.**

## VIII. ICP Definition: High-Ticket Service

**The Target:** Boring, cash-flowing service businesses where the founder is the bottleneck.

**Qualifying Criteria (ALL must be true):**
| Attribute | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Revenue** | $300K – $5M/year | Below = pre-product. Above = enterprise complexity. |
| **Price Point** | $2,000+ per engagement | Below = commodity. Above = enterprise sales cycle. |
| **Delivery** | Human-intensive, expertise-based | Not SaaS, not physical product, not retail. |
| **Team** | Solo to 10 FTEs | Beyond 10 = different operational constraints. |
| **Founder Role** | **Primary delivery, sales, or decision bottleneck** | If founder absence doesn't hurt revenue, we have no leverage. |
| **Revenue Dependency** | Relies on founder availability | If revenue is decoupled from founder, system creates false positives. |

**Examples (IN):**
- Solo consultants scaling past themselves
- Small agencies where founder still sells or delivers
- Professional services where delegation is feared, not mastered
- Coaches who are the product

**Examples (OUT):**
- VC-backed startups optimizing for growth at any cost
- E-commerce / DTC brands (product, not service)
- Businesses where founder absence does not impact revenue
- Teams already operating with managerial redundancy
- SaaS companies — *Different constraint set*

**Future Verticals (Waitlist Until Ready):**
- Commodity Service (Low-Ticket)
- Brick & Mortar Retail
- Manufacturing SMB

## IX. The Irreversibility Rule (Incentive Discipline)

> **A behavior only counts if reversing it would create real operational pain.**

**Why This Exists:**
Without irreversibility, founders will:
- Click "Mark as Delegated" then quietly take the task back.
- Write SOPs that no one ever uses.
- Commit to cadences they immediately abandon.

This corrupts data, destroys lender trust, and makes the product a theater of compliance.

**Enforcement:**
| Action | Counts Only If... |
|---|---|
| "Mark as Delegated" | Someone else has executed the SOP at least once, OR system re-validates in 7 days. |
| "Commit to Rhythm" | The cadence is tracked over time with proof events (not just intent). |
| "SOP Created" | At least one "used by" event is logged. |

**The Test:**
Before marking any constraint as "reduced," ask:
> "Could the founder undo this silently next week with zero friction?"

If yes, it doesn't count.

## X. Toothbrush Guardrail Checklist

> All modules must pass these guardrails before shipping.

### 1. Daily Usage Check
- ✅ Will this feature generate a micro-behavior founders interact with daily?
- ❌ Episodic-only features defer until core behavior loop is enforced.

### 2. Irreversibility Check
- ✅ Every action creates observable consequences if reversed.
- ❌ Self-reported completion or optional execution fails.

### 3. One Constraint at a Time
- ✅ Module focuses on one dominant constraint.
- ❌ Multiple priorities → shame, paralysis, feature creep.

### 4. Fundability Signal Test
- ✅ Generates Gold evidence (external execution, measurable outcome).
- ❌ Bronze-only evidence is internal, not fundability-grade.

### 5. Behavioral-first, Not Feature-first
- ✅ Solves acute behavioral pain.
- ❌ Ornamental "nice-to-have" features postponed to Phase 3.

### Evidence Decay Rule
> Bronze evidence decays to "Unverified" after 14 days without confirmation.
