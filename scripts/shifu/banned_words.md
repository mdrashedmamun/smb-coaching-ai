# Banned Words List (The "No Jargon" Rule)

**Purpose:** Engineers can use these words internally (in code comments, variables, PRDs). **Users must NEVER see them.**

If a word requires an explanation, it does not belong in the UI.

| Banned Word (Internal Only) | Allowed Alternative (User Facing) | Why? |
|---|---|---|
| **Protocol** | Plan, Habit, System, Way | Sounds like a hospital or sci-fi movie. |
| **Diagnostic** | Check-up, Review, Audit, Look | Too clinical. |
| **Mechanism** | Tool, Way, How | Too mechanical. |
| **Cadence** | Schedule, Routine, How often | Corporate speak. |
| **Irreversibility** | Commitment, Real, Locked in | Abstract academic concept. |
| **Infrastructure** | Setup, Foundation, Tools | IT jargon. |
| **Evidence / Decay** | Proof, Trust Score, Stale | Sounds like a crime scene. |
| **Optimize** | Improve, Fix, Make better | Overused tech buzzword. |
| **Execute** | Do, Start, Finish | Too aggressive/robotic. |
| **Function / Logic** | How it works, Rules | Dev speak. |
