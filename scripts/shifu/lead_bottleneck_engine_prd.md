## Problem Alignment

### Problem Statement
High-ticket service founders know they need more leads but don't do consistent outreach. Existing tools (calendars, CRMs, VAs) remind them but don't confront them with why they're avoiding the work or hold them accountable when they skip.

### Why This Matters

**To Customers:**
- They're stuck at $10-30K/month and can't break through
- They know outreach works but don't do it consistently
- They waste money on tools that don't address the real problem (behavior, not technology)

**To Business:**
- Direct revenue impact: founders who fix their lead problem will pay to stay
- Retention moat: behavioral data creates switching cost
- Premium positioning: we're not a CRM, we're a coach that remembers

## High Level Approach

A **Hot Seat Simulator** that:

### Phase 0: Offer Health Check (Prerequisite)
> **"You could write the best sequence in the world and it really doesn't matter if you have an offer problem."** — Cole

1. **Validates** the offer is sellable (UESA: Unique, Expensive, Sticky, Air)
2. **Confirms** right target (Pain, Passion, or Profession + Buyer Filters)
3. **Checks** pricing viability (Close rate ladder, 80%+ gross margins)
4. **Short-circuits** if offer is broken: *"Your bottleneck isn't leads. It's your offer."*

### Phase 1: Lead Bottleneck Audit (Core)
1. **Audits** the founder's lead funnel (8 core metrics)
2. **Identifies** the specific bottleneck (volume, skill, belief)
3. **Surfaces** the soft bottleneck behind it (time, energy, attention, effort)
4. **Prescribes** one action with a specific number

### Phase 2: Accountability Loop
1. **Holds accountable** via weekly check-ins that confront, not remind
2. **Stores admissions** for pattern surfacing
3. **Re-engages** founders who drop off

## Narrative

### Scenario A: The Zero Outreach Founder

**Today (without the product):**
> "I'm stuck at $15K/month. I know I should do more outreach but I'm so busy with fulfillment. I've tried Apollo, Instantly, hired a VA... nothing works. I guess my niche is saturated."

**With Lead Bottleneck Audit:**
> The system asks: "How many cold outreaches did you send this week?"
> Founder enters: "0"
> System responds: "Your bottleneck is not your niche. It's that your outreach is zero. This week: 20 Looms. Report back Friday."
> Friday: "Did you send 20 Looms? [Yes] [No – Tell me why]"
> Founder clicks "No" → "What got in the way?"
> System stores the admission: "You said fulfillment was the reason. Noted. Next week: same prescription."

### Scenario B: The Price-Too-Low Founder

**Today:**
> "I have 6 clients at $3K each. I want to get to $50K/month but I'm maxed out on capacity."

**With Lead Bottleneck Audit:**
> System calculates: "At $3K/client, you'd need 17 clients to hit $50K. That's unsustainable."
> System diagnoses: "Your bottleneck isn't more clients. It's your price. Raise to $5K."
> Prescription: "This week: Tell 3 existing clients your rates are changing. By October 1st, all clients on new rate."
> Check-in: "Did you have the conversation? [Yes] [No – Tell me why]"

### Scenario C: The Shiny New Offer Founder

**Today:**
> "I get a lot of inbound from broke founders who can't afford my $5K offer. I'm thinking of building a $2K offer for them."

**With Lead Bottleneck Audit:**
> System asks: "If you knew with 100% certainty that 100 quality Looms would max out your capacity at $5K, would you still want to build the $2K offer?"
> Founder: "...No."
> System: "Then we're not building that. This week: 20 Looms to qualified prospects. Report back."

### Scenario D: The Broken Offer Founder

**Today (without the product):**
> "I close about 15% of my sales calls. That's pretty normal for my industry, right? I've tried everything — better ads, more content, hired a VA to do outreach. Nothing moves the needle."

**With Lead Bottleneck Audit (Phase 0):**
> System asks: "What's your close rate on sales calls?"
> Founder enters: "15%"
> System responds: "At 15%, you have an avatar or sales motion issue — not a lead problem. Below 30% means either you're selling to the wrong people, or your sales process isn't educating them before the call."
> System asks: "What's your gross margin after delivery cost?"
> Founder: "About 50%"
> System: **"Your bottleneck isn't leads. It's your offer."**
> "50% gross margin means you've commoditized your service. At these margins, you can't afford to scale marketing, hire talent, or weather bad months."
> System: "Before we audit your lead funnel, let's fix the offer. Read: $100M Offers. Then return."

### Scenario E: The Under-Priced Operator

**Today:**
> "I'm closing 75% of everyone I talk to. My calendar is packed. But I'm still only at $20K/month."

**With Lead Bottleneck Audit (Phase 0):**
> System calculates: "75% close rate signals you're underpriced by 2-3x."
> System asks: "What do you charge per client?"
> Founder: "$2K"
> System: "At $2K with 75% close rate, you should test $5K. Expect close rate to drop to 40-50%, but you'll make more money."
> System: "This week: Pitch your next 3 prospects at $5K. Report back."
> System: "Then we're not building that. This week: 20 Looms to qualified prospects. Report back."

## Goals

| Priority | Goal | Measurable? |
|----------|------|-------------|
| P0 | Founders identify their SPECIFIC lead bottleneck (not a vague "need more leads") | Yes: Bottleneck identified in <5 minutes |
| P0 | Founders take ONE prescribed action each week | Yes: Action completion rate >50% |
| P1 | Founders feel confronted, not coddled | Feeling: "This product sees through my excuses" |
| P1 | Founders return weekly to report | Yes: Weekly return rate >60% |
| P2 | Founders show measurable improvement in lead metrics over 30 days | Yes: Self-reported metric improvement |

## Non-Goals (What We Refuse To Do)

> **This product is a mirror, not a massage.**

| Non-Goal | Why Not |
|----------|---------|
| **Get you leads** | We don't do the outreach for you. We diagnose why you're not doing it. |
| **Write your copy** | We don't write emails, scripts, or DMs. That's execution. We do diagnosis. |
| **Automate outreach** | We're not a CRM. Automation without diagnosis is delusion at scale. |
| **Motivate you emotionally** | We confront, not coddle. If you want cheerleading, hire a hype coach. |
| **Teach sales skills** | That's what training programs are for. We surface the bottleneck, not fix it for you. |
| **Support all business types** | Focus: High-ticket service founders only. E-commerce, SaaS, local = wrong tool. |
| **Gamification** | No streaks, badges, or leaderboards. Psychological accountability, not dopamine. |

## Solution Alignment

### Key Features

#### Phase 0: Offer Health Check (Prerequisite)

| Priority | Feature | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| P0 | **Close Rate Check** | "What's your close rate on sales calls?" — Below 30% = avatar or sales motion issue, NOT leads |
| P0 | **Gross Margin Check** | "What's your gross margin after delivery?" — Below 80% = commoditized offer |
| P0 | **Price Signal Detection** | Close rate 80%+ = underpriced 3-4x, 60-80% = underpriced 2-3x |
| P0 | **Offer Short-Circuit** | If offer is broken: *"Your bottleneck isn't leads. It's your offer."* |
| P1 | **LTV:CAC Viability Check** | Based on humans in loop: 0=3:1, 1=6:1, 2=9:1, 3=12:1 minimum |

**Reference Benchmarks:**

| Close Rate | Price Signal | Action |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| 80%+ | Underpriced 3-4x | Raise price aggressively |
| 60-80% | Underpriced 2-3x | Consider 2x price |
| 50-60% | Underpriced 1.5-2x | Test $150 if at $100 |
| 40-50% | Underpriced 1.25-1.5x | Test $125 |
| 30-40% | Appropriately priced | Proceed to lead audit |
| Below 30% | Avatar or sales issue | Fix offer/sales first |

| P0 | **Actuals Audit** | Collect: Last 30 days revenue, broken down by client and offer |
| P0 | **8-Metric Funnel Audit** | Collect: Cold outreach, cold responses, warm outreach, warm responses, inbound, Looms filmed, sales calls, clients closed |
| P0 | **Gap Calculation** | System shows: "You're at $X. Goal is $Y. Gap is $Z." |
| P0 | **Model Play-Out** | System shows: "At $X/client, you'd need Y clients. Is that sustainable?" |
| P0 | **Bottleneck Detection** | System identifies: Volume, Skill, or Belief problem |
| P0 | **Soft Bottleneck Probe** | System asks: "What's getting in the way? Time, Energy, Attention, or Effort?" |
| P0 | **Lead Bottleneck Verdict** | Synthesis screen: Shows model visually, delivers verdict, presents path options, curates advice |
| P0 | **Prescription Engine** | System prescribes: "This week: [Action] × [Number]" |

**Reference Benchmarks (Rule of 100):**

| Scenario | Expected Conversion |
|----------|---------------------|
| Meta leads (in-person service) | 10% of leads close |
| Cold webinar (broad market) | 2-3% of leads close |
| Cold webinar (niched) | 5% of leads close |
| Salesperson calls | 35% of appointments close |
| Lead response > 60 seconds | 4x cost per customer |

#### Phase 2: Accountability Loop

| Priority | Feature | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| P1 | **Dynamic Next-Step Calculation** | Calculate CTA based on position: "Start audit" / "Get prescription" / "Report results" |
| P1 | **Accountability Check-In** | Weekly: "Did you do [Action]? [Yes] [No – Tell me why]" |
| P1 | **Admission Storage** | System stores: "You said [reason] was the blocker." |
| P1 | **Re-engagement System** | Follow-up: Started but didn't finish → Reminder. Got prescription but didn't report → Follow-up. |
| P2 | **Pattern Surfacing** | System shows: "You've skipped outreach for 3 weeks. Here's what your numbers show." |
| P2 | **Re-Audit Prompt** | Monthly: "Let's re-audit your funnel. What are your numbers now?" |

#### Future Considerations

| Feature | Save For Later Because... |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Automated outreach tracking (via API) | Increases complexity. Start with self-report. |
| CRM integration | Not core to accountability. Nice-to-have. |
| Peer comparison ("Founders like you...") | Requires cohort data. Later. |
| AI-generated outreach scripts | Training, not accountability. Different product. |
| LTV:CAC Calculator (detailed) | Requires churn data, delivery costs. Later. |
| Organic Content Vortex Builder | Execution tool, not diagnosis. Different product. |

### Key Logic

#### Bottleneck Detection Rules

| Metric Pattern | Detected Bottleneck | Prescription |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Outreach = 0 | **Volume (Outreach)** | "Send X Looms/DMs this week." |
| Outreach > 50, Responses = 0 | **Skill (Messaging)** | "Your messages aren't landing. Let's review 3 together." |
| Responses > 10, Calls = 0 | **Volume (Follow-up)** | "You have interest but aren't following up. Book X calls." |
| Calls > 5, Closed = 0 | **Skill (Sales)** | "You're not closing. Let's review a call recording." |
| Revenue ÷ Clients < $4K | **Price** | "Raise price to $5K. Pitch new clients at new rate." |
| Clients > 10, Capacity = 0 | **Capacity** | "You're full. Raise price or drop lowest-paying client." |

#### Soft Bottleneck Mapping

| Soft Bottleneck | Follow-Up Question | Stored Admission |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Time | "What would you need to drop to make time?" | "[Founder] admitted time is the blocker." |
| Energy | "What's draining you? Fulfillment? Admin?" | "[Founder] admitted energy is the blocker." |
| Attention | "What's distracting you? Client reactivity?" | "[Founder] admitted attention is the blocker." |
| Effort | "Are you avoiding the discomfort of outreach?" | "[Founder] admitted effort is the blocker." |
| Belief | "Do you believe outreach works for your niche?" | "[Founder] admitted a belief problem." |

#### Prescription Logic

> **Escalation is deliberately uncomfortable, not adaptive convenience.**
> The system is a mirror, not a massage. If you skip, we don't lower the bar—we hold it and ask why.

| Constraint | Default Prescription | Escalation Note |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| First audit, Outreach = 0 | "20 Looms this week." | Initial prescription. Clear target. |
| Second week, still 0 | "10 Looms this week. What would make 10 possible?" | Halved, but now we probe. |
| Third week, still 0 | "5 Looms. Just 5. What's the blocker?" | **This is the confrontation moment.** If you can't do 5, something deeper is wrong. |
| Completed last week | "Same or +10% volume. Keep momentum." | Reinforce, don't celebrate. |
| Price bottleneck | "Tell 3 existing clients your rates are changing." | The uncomfortable conversation you're avoiding. |

## Launch Plan

### Key Milestones

| Target Date | Milestone | Description | Exit Criteria |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Week 1 | ✅ V0 Build | Build intake + audit + prescription flow | Functional flow, no accountability yet |
| Week 2 | 🛑 Internal Test | Rashed uses it on self | Identifies real bottleneck, receives prescription |
| Week 3 | 🛑 Beta (5 founders) | Hand-pick 5 high-ticket founders | 3/5 complete audit, 2/5 report back |
| Week 4 | 🛑 Paid Pilot ($9) | Charge $9 for audit | 10 paid audits completed |
| Week 6 | 🛑 Starter Launch ($29/mo) | Add weekly accountability loop | 5 founders on recurring |

### Operational Checklist

| Team | Prompt | Y/N | Action (if yes) |
|------|--------|-----|-----------------|
| Analytics | Do you need additional tracking? | Y | Track: audit completion, bottleneck distribution, check-in return rate |
| Sales | Do you need sales enablement materials? | N | Self-serve at $9/$29 |
| Marketing | Does this impact shared KPI? | Y | New KPI: audits completed, weekly return rate |
| Customer Success | Do you need to update support content? | N | Not yet |
| Product Marketing | Do you need a GTM plan? | Y | Position as: "Your lead problem isn't technology. It's behavior." |

## Appendix

### ⚠️ Coach's Guidance: Constitution, Not Checklist

> **"This document is not a product spec. It is a constitution."**

The principles documented in `high_ticket_business_principles.md` are the **reference layer** — not a feature backlog.

**This document SHOULD be:**
- The reason a gate exists
- The justification for short-circuit logic
- The source of truth when team debates arise
- Physics textbook, not the rocket

**This document SHOULD NOT be:**
- A checklist shown to founders
- A UI mirror of everything
- The entire knowledge base surfaced at once

#### Key Constraints from Coach:

1. **Benchmarks are priors, not verdicts**
   - Good: "At your price and audience, 18% is below expected."
   - Bad: "You are failing."
   - The system should **compute tension**, not just judge.

2. **Rule of 100 is a lever, not a hammer**
   - Adapt to channel, founder capacity, business model
   - Use to expose under-volume, normalize inconsistency
   - Not as a purity test

3. **Truth velocity control**
   - Stage truths
   - Defer some consequences
   - Remember admissions and replay them later
   - Don't overwhelm with all truths at once

4. **When debating features, ask one question:**
   > "Which principle does this enforce, and which does it violate?"
   
   If the answer is fuzzy, don't build it.

### Changelog

| 2026-01-12 | Added: Coach's guidance on using principles as constitution (gravity), not checklist (decoration). |
| 2026-01-12 | **Coach approved.** Applied 3 precision cuts: (1) Economic promise at top, (2) Explicit refusals in Non-Goals, (3) Uncomfortable escalation emphasis. Problem + Solution sign-offs complete. |

### Open Questions

| Question | Status | Answer |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Should we collect exact client names or just numbers? | ⬜ Open | |
| How do we verify self-reported metrics? | ⬜ Open | Start with trust. Add verification later. |
| Should prescription be AI-generated or rule-based? | ⬜ Open | Start rule-based. Simpler. |

### FAQs

**Q: How is this different from a CRM?**
A: CRMs track leads. We confront founders about why they're not generating leads.

**Q: How is this different from a calendar reminder?**
A: Calendars remind. We remember your admissions and pattern-surface your avoidance.

**Q: What if the founder lies about their numbers?**
A: They're only lying to themselves. The pattern will reveal it over time.
